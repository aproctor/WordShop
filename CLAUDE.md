# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

WordShop is a Unity 6 (6000.3.0f1) game project using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP). This is a fresh project setup with minimal custom code at this time.

## Key Technologies

- **Unity Version**: 6000.3.0f1
- **Render Pipeline**: Universal Render Pipeline (URP) 17.3.0
- **Input System**: New Input System 1.16.0
- **MCP Integration**: unity-mcp package from CoplayDev for Model Context Protocol support

```

## Development Commands

### Opening and Building
- Open the project in Unity Editor (Unity Hub or directly)
- Build: Use Unity Editor's Build Settings (File → Build Settings)
- Solution file: `WordShop.slnx` (use with Visual Studio or Rider)

### IDE Integration
- Primary solution: `WordShop.slnx` (configured in .vscode/settings.json)
- Supported IDEs: Visual Studio, Rider
- C# project files are auto-generated by Unity

### Testing
- Test Framework: Unity Test Framework 1.16.0
- Run tests via Unity Editor: Window → General → Test Runner
- Supports both Edit Mode and Play Mode tests

## Architecture Notes

### Render Pipeline Configuration
The project uses URP with separate configurations for PC and Mobile platforms:
- **PC**: `Assets/Settings/PC_RPAsset.asset` and `PC_Renderer.asset`
- **Mobile**: `Assets/Settings/Mobile_RPAsset.asset` and `Mobile_Renderer.asset`
- Volume profiles for post-processing in `Assets/Settings/`

### Input System
Uses Unity's new Input System package rather than the legacy input manager. Input actions are defined in `Assets/InputSystem_Actions.inputactions`.

### MCP Integration
The project includes `com.coplaydev.unity-mcp` package installed from GitHub. This provides Model Context Protocol integration within Unity, though it's not yet actively used in the codebase.

## C# Development

### Code Location
Custom game scripts should be placed in `Assets/Scripts/` (directory not yet created).

### Namespace Convention
When creating new scripts, use appropriate namespaces based on functionality (e.g., `WordShop.Gameplay`, `WordShop.UI`, `WordShop.Core`).

### Unity API Patterns
- Prefer the new Input System over legacy `Input` class
- Use URP-specific rendering features when applicable
- Follow Unity's component-based architecture

## Git Configuration

Standard Unity `.gitignore` is configured to exclude:
- `/Library`, `/Temp`, `/obj` - Unity-generated directories
- `*.csproj`, `*.sln` - Auto-generated solution files (except .slnx)
- `UserSettings/`, `Logs/` - User-specific and temporary files
- IDE files: `.vs/`, `.idea/`, `.vscode/`

## Package Dependencies

Key packages (see `Packages/manifest.json` for complete list):
- Universal Render Pipeline: 17.3.0
- Input System: 1.16.0
- AI Navigation: 2.0.9
- Timeline: 1.8.9
- Visual Scripting: 1.9.9
- unity-mcp: from GitHub (CoplayDev)

## Current State

This is a minimal project setup. The only custom code is tutorial boilerplate (`Readme.cs`). The project is configured with modern Unity features (URP, new Input System) and ready for game development to begin.
