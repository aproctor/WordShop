I'd like to create a WORDLE game where a users are given a random 5 letter word, and 6 chances to guess the correct word.

If the user's guess has a correct letter in the correct location I'd like to color that letter Green.  If they have guessed a correct letter but not in the right position I'd like to color the letter orange.  Incorrect letters should be colored grey.

We should have an on-screen keyboard in QWERTY layout.  The keys should be disabled when they are guessed and incorrect.
